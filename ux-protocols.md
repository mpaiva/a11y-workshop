# UX Protocol for Inclusive Usability Studies

This protocol serves as a comprehensive guide designed to assist our UX designers and researchers in effectively conducting usability studies with participants who have disabilities. This document outlines best practices for preparation, communication, session management, and post-session activities, ensuring that all aspects of a study are accessible and considerate of diverse needs.

UX professionals may utilize this protocol as a framework for planning and executing usability tests, from the initial participant profile collection through to the final analysis of feedback. Whether new to conducting inclusive research or looking to refine your approach, this protocol aims to foster environments where all participants can engage comfortably and effectively, ultimately leading to richer insights and a more inclusive product design.

## 1. Pre-Session Preparation

This section outlines the steps necessary to prepare for a session. It focuses on understanding the specific needs of participants and ensuring that the testing environment is fully accessible.

### Participant Profile

Collect essential information about the participant's disability and necessary accommodations.

- **Participant who is Blind**: Identify requirements for screen reader compatibility (e.g., JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver) or need for tactile feedback.
  - **Benefit**: Ensures that visually presented information is accessible, promoting independence in interaction.
- **Participant with Cognitive Disabilities**: Determine whether the participant needs clear, simple instructions, visual aids, or more time to comprehend tasks. Consider specific conditions like ADHD, dyslexia, or autism.
  - **Benefit**: Enhances the ability to participate meaningfully, reducing frustration and improving data quality.
- **Participant with Mobility Impairments**: Assess the need for physical accommodations, such as wheelchair access, adjustable tables, or input devices.
  - **Benefit**: Facilitates comfortable and unhindered participation throughout the usability study.

### Communication Preferences

Ensure that communication methods are accessible and flexible.

- **Deaf Participant**: Determine the need for real-time captioning, sign language interpreters, or other visual communication tools.
  - **Benefit**: Enhances the ability to follow instructions and engage in the session effectively.
- **Participant with Cognitive Disabilities**: Offer instructions in various formats (written, visual, or auditory) to accommodate different processing needs.

### Accessibility Check

Verify that both the physical and digital environments are accessible:

- Ensure the digital interfaces used are fully accessible according to [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/). Pay special attention to keyboard navigation, color contrast, and timing adjustments.
- For physical locations, check that the testing area is accessible to participants with mobility impairments (e.g., accessible entrances, restrooms, and testing stations).

## 2. Session Management

Manage the session in an inclusive and adaptable way. Be mindful of participant needs during the session.

### Pace and Adaptability

- Adapt the pace of the session based on the participant's needs. For example, provide extra time for tasks or reduce the complexity of instructions for participants with cognitive disabilities.

### Flexible Communication

- Use clear and accessible communication, especially for participants with hearing or cognitive disabilities. Rephrase instructions as needed and offer alternative methods for feedback (e.g., written or visual communication).

### Monitor Physical Comfort

- Ensure that participants with mobility impairments have access to accessible seating, tables, and input devices. Adjust the environment if necessary to improve their comfort during the session.

## 3. Post-Session Activities

### Participant Feedback

After the session, gather feedback from participants on the accessibility of the study. Provide specific questions on the accommodations used and how they felt about the inclusiveness of the session.

- **General**: Include a question asking participants to assess the accessibility of both the session environment and communication methods.
- **Blind Participant**: Gather feedback on the effectiveness of screen reader compatibility or tactile feedback during the session.
- **Deaf Participant**: Reassess the effectiveness of visual communication tools and interpreter services.
- **Participant with Cognitive Disabilities**: Review session formats and information delivery methods to better accommodate cognitive variations.

### Training and Awareness

Keep the research team updated on the latest in disability awareness and assistive technology.

- **General**: Provide ongoing training on disability etiquette, new technologies, and legal requirements for accessibility.
  - **Benefit**: Ensures that the team remains knowledgeable and sensitive to the needs of all participants, fostering a respectful and inclusive research environment.
- **Emerging Technologies**: Hold sessions on using advanced eye-tracking systems or AI-driven accessibility tools.
  - **Benefit**: Keeps the team at the forefront of technological advancements, which can be leveraged to enhance the inclusivity and effectiveness of usability studies.
