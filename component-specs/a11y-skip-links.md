## Component 1: Skip Links

### Gherkin Story

```gherkin
Feature: Skip Links

  Scenario: A user with motor impairment navigates using keyboard-only
    Given I am a user with motor impairment
    When I load the job search page
    Then I should be able to focus on a skip link with the tab key
    And the skip link should allow me to jump directly to the main content

  Scenario: A screen reader user navigates using skip links
    Given I am a screen reader user
    When I land on the page
    Then the skip link should be announced as "Skip to main content"
    And I should be able to activate the link to bypass the navigation bar
```

### Expected Interaction Design and Keystrokes

- **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - Upon page load, the skip link is the first focusable element.
  - Press `Tab` key to focus on the skip link.
  - Press `Enter` to activate the skip link, which moves focus to the main content area.

- **Screen Reader Behavior:**
  - Skip link is announced as "Skip to main content, link."
  - Activating the link moves the screen reader focus to the main content.

### Component Anatomy

- **Elements:**
  - An `<a>` (anchor) element with:
    - `href` attribute pointing to the `id` of the main content.
    - Visible text: "Skip to main content."
  - Hidden by default, visible when focused.

### Properties

- **Size:**
  - **Width:** Auto (based on text length).
  - **Height:** At least 44px to meet touch target guidelines.

  - Visible on focus (`left: 0;`).

### States

- **Visual States:**
  - **Default:** Hidden from view.
