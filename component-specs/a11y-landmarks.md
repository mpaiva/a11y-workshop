## Component 2: Landmark Regions

### Gherkin Story

```gherkin
Feature: Landmark Regions

  Scenario: A screen reader user navigates using landmarks
    Given I am using a screen reader
    When I land on the job search page
    Then the screen reader should announce "Main region" when I enter the main content area
    And I should be able to quickly navigate between header, main, and footer using screen reader commands
  
  Scenario: A keyboard-only user navigates using landmarks
    Given I am a keyboard-only user
    When I navigate through the page
    Then I should be able to skip from the header to the footer by using keyboard controls
```

### Expected Interaction Design and Keystrokes

- **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - Use the `Tab` key to navigate between focusable elements within the landmark regions.
  - `Shift + Tab` to navigate backward.
  - Screen readers allow users to jump between regions using landmark navigation.

- **Screen Reader Behavior:**
  - Announce each landmark region (e.g., "Main region," "Footer region").
  - Allow direct navigation between regions using screen reader commands.

### Component Anatomy

- **Elements:**
  - HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
  - Use of ARIA roles like `role="navigation"`, `role="main"`, `role="contentinfo"` where necessary.

### Properties

- **Size:**
  - No specific size, landmark regions are containers for other elements.
  
- **Positioning:**
  - Depends on the layout; typically, header at the top, footer at the bottom, main content in between.

- **Focus Management:**
  - Users can tab through regions.
  - Screen readers allow landmark-based navigation.

### States

- **Visual States:**
  - No specific visual styles required, but regions can be visually emphasized with spacing, borders, or background colors.

- **ARIA States:**
  - ARIA roles such as `role="banner"` for the header, `role="main"` for the main content, and `role="contentinfo"` for the footer.
  - ARIA landmarks should be used consistently for clarity.

### Design Tokens

- **Typography:**
  - **Font Family:** `Arial, sans-serif` (inherited from the body).
  - **Font Size:** `16px` (default).

- **Colors:**
  - **Background Color:** May use `#F5F5F5` for the header and footer to visually distinguish regions.
  
- **Spacing:**
  - **Margin:** `16px 0` for separation between regions.
  - **Padding:** `16px` for content inside the regions.

### Applicable WCAG Criteria

- **1.3.1 Info and Relationships:** Landmark regions provide proper structure.
- **2.1.1 Keyboard:** Navigation between landmarks must be keyboard accessible.
- **2.4.1 Bypass Blocks:** Use of landmarks helps users skip repetitive content.
- **2.4.6 Headings and Labels:** Landmarks should be appropriately labeled to convey their purpose.

### Alignment with WCAG Tokens

- **Spacing Tokens:** Ensure consistent margins and padding to provide separation between regions.
- **Background Color Tokens:** Use tokens that maintain proper contrast (minimum 4.5:1) for text against the background.

### WCAG Success Criteria Checklist

**Product:**

- [ ] Define requirements for semantic HTML5 regions.
- [ ] Ensure each page has at least a header, main, and footer.

**Design:**

- [ ] Use consistent visual separation between landmark regions.
- [ ] Apply appropriate spacing and background colors to enhance clarity.

**Development:**

- [ ] Implement HTML5 semantic elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`).
- [ ] Ensure correct ARIA roles for landmark regions.
- [ ] Enable focus management and ensure smooth navigation.

**QA:**

- [ ] Verify screen readers announce each region with proper labels.
- [ ] Test tab navigation through the regions.
- [ ] Ensure the presence of keyboard navigation for users to skip between header, main, and footer.
